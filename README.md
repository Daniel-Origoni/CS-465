README for Travlr Getaways Full Stack Web Application

Architecture

In the Travlr Getaways Full Stack Web Application, we used various frontend development tools such as Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA) using Angular. The Express HTML and JavaScript were used for the static customer-facing website while the SPA was used for the administrative functions to manage the database.

The backend used MongoDB database because it is a schema-less database and stores data in a JSON-like format, which makes it easier to work with in a MEAN stack application.

Functionality

In the Travlr Getaways Full Stack Web Application, we used JSON files to store initial data for seeding the database and to return data from the API endpoints to the frontend.

We created reusable user interface (UI) components such as navigation, footer, and search bar, which made it easier to build the SPA and the customer-facing website. The benefits of reusable UI components are that they reduce code duplication, improve code maintainability, and enhance the consistency and user experience of the application.

Testing

To test the API endpoints, we used Postman testing each endpoint for its expected response, error handling, and security. We added a layer of security by producing web tokens for web-login authentication.

Reflection

This course has provided me with the skills and knowledge necessary to build a full stack web application using the MEAN stack. I have learned and developed skills in frontend development, backend development, database management, API development, and security.
